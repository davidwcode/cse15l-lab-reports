# Week 1 Lab Report (9/29/22)
David Wang

These were the six goals for today:
* Install VS Code
* Remotely connect to UCSD computers with ssh
* Navigate in those computers with terminal commands
* Copy files over with scp
* Set up an ssh key to make my life easier
* Learn other ways of making my life easier

## Installing VS Code
I already had VS Code installed before this class, and if I remember correctly, I just downloaded the application from the website and ran it.
